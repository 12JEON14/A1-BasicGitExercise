    <p>When I was born, my mother was very happy because she had a child who was incredibly handsome, and they named him Anjo—that was me. Anjo comes from the combined names of my parents. My mom’s name is Ana Liza, so they took 'An' from it, and my dad’s name is Joselito, so they took 'Jo' to create Anjo. They didn’t even give me a second name. It’s a simple name, yet it carries so much meaning, a fusion of my parents’ identities that I’ll carry with me throughout my life.</p>
    
<p>I don’t remember much from when I was a child, but if I do recall anything, it’s the accidents that seemed to follow me because of my playfulness. Even from a young age, I had an adventurous spirit, always jumping around, exploring, and sometimes, unintentionally getting myself into trouble.</p>

<p>I remember one incident vividly—when I was jumping around in our backyard, filled with nothing but energy, I ended up sitting on my hand in a way that caused intense pain. I cried loudly because I thought something had broken. It was excruciating, and I could feel that something was wrong with my hand. My grandfather was the only one around to witness it at that moment, because my parents were not at home. My mom is a teacher, and she was working at the time, while my dad is a tricycle driver, and he was out on a trip. I can still recall the look of concern on my grandfather’s face as he tried to comfort me. He placed a bamboo stick on my hand to try and straighten it, though it wasn’t the best idea.</p>

<p>When my parents arrived, my dad was furious. He asked my grandfather why he didn’t take me straight to the hospital instead of trying to manage it himself. We eventually went to the ITMRC Hospital, and after an X-ray, we found out that my hand had a fractured bone. The doctors had to put a cast on it, and I wore it for over a month. But even with the cast, I didn’t stop being my playful self. I kept jumping and running around, as if nothing had happened. My mom was probably more worried than she let on, but at that time, I didn’t really understand the full gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>The second major accident I remember happened during a school activity. I was running around with my classmates, and I’m not sure if I tripped over something or if someone accidentally pushed me, but the side of my forehead hit the sharp edge of a table. I could feel the sting immediately, and before I knew it, blood started to flow down my face. I was rushed to the school clinic, and the nurse said I needed stitches. What’s funny is that I remember how my teacher and my mom, who had rushed to the school, blamed my classmate for the accident. They thought someone had pushed me, but in my mind, I knew that no one had pushed me. It wasn’t anyone’s fault but my own—my clumsiness got the best of me. I had tripped, and it was a hard lesson to learn, though I didn’t exactly learn from it at the time.</p>

<p>Despite these accidents, my childhood was still filled with fun and mischief. We lived behind a cemetery, a place that would have made some people nervous, but for me, it became a playground of sorts. I remember enjoying the peace and quiet there and exploring its many corners. One time, I found a tree with a beehive attached to it, and in a moment of foolish curiosity, I threw something at the bees. The next thing I knew, the bees swarmed out of the hive, chasing my sister and me. We ran as fast as we could, but the bees were relentless, and we ended up with swollen bodies from all the stings. When we got home, Mom was furious with us. She scolded us for our recklessness and told us not to be so daring in the future, but I didn’t learn my lesson right away.</p>

<p>To try and tame my mischievous nature, my mom decided to enroll me in taekwondo. She thought it might teach me discipline and channel my boundless energy into something constructive. I was excited at first and learned the basics of taekwondo, like the attention stance, ready stance, horse stance, back stance, and fighting stance. I also learned some self-defense moves that I thought were pretty cool. However, I didn’t stick with it for long. My short attention span and constant desire for excitement led me to lose interest, and soon, I was back to my old ways. Despite this, I still remember some of the moves and lessons I learned from my brief time in taekwondo, and in hindsight, I realize that it could have been beneficial if I had continued with it.</p>

<p>As I grew older, I began to calm down a bit. My restlessness wasn’t as intense as it used to be, but I still had an affinity for sports. I discovered a love for Sepak Takraw, a sport that was both physically demanding and exciting. I joined the school team and quickly found that I had a natural talent for the game. I trained hard and participated in several competitions. To my surprise, I was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) in one of the tournaments, a moment I will never forget. It was an accomplishment that made me proud and gave me a sense of purpose and direction. It was a different kind of thrill than what I had experienced as a child, but it was just as fulfilling.</p>

<p>When I reached high school, my passion for Sepak Takraw only grew stronger. I continued playing and honing my skills, eventually making the varsity team in college. Being part of the team opened up new opportunities for me, but it also came with its challenges. The intense training and competitions left me with little time to focus on my studies. I found myself neglecting my academic responsibilities, and as a result, I ended up failing some subjects. I realized too late that I had been prioritizing the wrong things, and it became a hard lesson in balance and responsibility.</p>

<p>Then came a chapter in my life I would consider a nightmare—a relationship that changed everything. I met a woman, a witch, and impulsively fell in love with her. She got pregnant, and our relationship spiraled from there. I became responsible for a girl I thought was decent and kind, only to later realize that she wasn’t. I regret being with her, because my child she bore, because my child is truly a blessing from God. After eight years of being together, we eventually separated. And, while the end of the relationship was painful, I finally felt like I could breathe again, like I was free from the suffocating hold of that toxic bond. Thank God we were never married.</p>

<p>Still I knew I had a responsibility to my child, and that responsibility remains with me. I vowed to be a good father because I knew that I had already let him down by separating from his mother. It wasn’t easy, but I pushed forward for his sake.</p>

<p>I never thought I would find interest in another woman again after the trauma I went through, but fate has its way of surprising us. One day, I saw a young woman wearing a red dress at the cemetery. She was as beautiful as I remembered, even more so now. Her face reminded me of the girl who had glared at me for taking the candles. I thought to myself that maybe, just maybe, there was a chance for a better relationship in the future with her, and I hoped it would be my last.</p>

<p>Now, I’ve gone back to my studies. Partly, it’s because of the encouragement from the red girl. I want to graduate, not just for myself, but also for my child. I want to give my parents the best gift I can–the diploma that I know they will be proud of. It’s been a long journey, but I know I’m on the right path now.</p>
